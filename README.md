### Data Sources
Meter Data: The primary dataset use for this analysis is the "Meter Data.xlsx" specifically from worksheet D, containing information about the state of the meters.

### Project Goals

1. **K-Means Clustering Analysis**
   - Apply k-means clustering to the predictor variables.
   - Justify the chosen number of clusters.
   - Provide visualizations with titles including "K-Means".

2. **Hierarchical Clustering Analysis**
   - Apply hierarchical clustering to the predictor variables.
   - Justify the choice of distance metric and clustering method.
   - Provide visualizations with titles including "Hierarchical".

3. **Model-Based Clustering Analysis**
   - Apply model-based clustering to the predictor variables.
   - Justify the assumed model used.
   - Provide visualizations with titles including "Model Based".

4. **Variable Clustering Analysis**
   - Apply variable clustering to the predictor variables.
   - Justify the chosen method of clustering.
   - Provide visualizations with titles including "Variable Clustering".

5. **Variable Selection**
   - Perform variable selection on the predictor variables.
   - Justify the selection methods used.
   - Use at least one variable statistic and at least one model-based selection method.
